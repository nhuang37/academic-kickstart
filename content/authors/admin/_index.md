I am a PhD student in the Department of Applied Mathematics & Statistics at Johns Hopkins University. I am very fortunate to be co-advised by [Professor Soledad Villar](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/villar/) and [Professor Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/).

I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. In particular, I am passionate about understanding learning --- including machine learning and natural learning --- from mathematical and statistical principles. 

My research interests are in the areas of deep learning and representation learning. My current work focuses on generalization and robustness in deep learning, and spectral-inspired graph neural networks.
