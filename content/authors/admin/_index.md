I am a Flatiron Research Fellow in the [Center for Computational Mathematics](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/center-for-computational-mathematics/) at [Flatiron Institute](https://www.simonsfoundation.org/flatiron/). I am broadly interested in geometric deep learning and mechanistic understanding of foundation models.  


I completed my PhD in 2024 from Johns Hopkins University, where I was very fortunate to be co-advised by [Professor Soledad Villar](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/villar/) and [Professor Carey Priebe](https://www.ams.jhu.edu/~priebe/). I was a research intern at [Apple Machine Learning Research](https://machinelearning.apple.com/) in 2023 and 2024. 

<!-- I have no special talent. I am only passionately curious. In particular, I am passionate about understanding learning --- including machine learning and natural learning --- from mathematical and statistical principles. 

My research interests are in the areas of representation learning and deep learning. My current work focuses on expressivity and generalization properties of graph neural networks.  -->
