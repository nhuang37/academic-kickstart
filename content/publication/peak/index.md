abstract: 'Overparameterization is powerful: Very large models fit the training data perfectly and yet often generalize well. The risk curve of these models typically shows a double-descent phenomenon, characterized by peaking at the interpolation threshold and decreasing risk in the overparameterized regime. The double-descent behavior raises the following research questions: Can we avoid the peaking phenomenon? Is overparameterization necessary for good generalization? In this work, we proved that the peaking disappears with dimensionality reduction by providing non-asymptotic risk bounds. We compared a wide range of projection-based regression models and found that overparameterization may not be necessary for good generalization.'

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: We show PCA avoids the peaking phenomenon of double-descent, and overparameterization may not be necessary for good generalization.
